        Add hover effects and micro-animations for buttons and cards

    2. Mobile & Responsive Design

        Make the UI fully responsive using Tailwind CSS

        Add a collapsible mobile navbar

        Ensure course pages, login/register, and review forms display well on mobile

    3. Search & Filter Features

        Add a global search bar to find courses by name, professor, or code

        Implement filter options (e.g., difficulty, rating, number of tips)

        Display a message when no search results are found

    4. User Experience Upgrades

        Redirect users to the course page after posting a review or tip

        Show error messages when login or review submission fails

        Prevent file uploads > 10MB and show a warning if exceeded

            AI-generated course summaries

            Bookmarking courses

            Admin panel with basic moderation tools

    6. Clean Code & Structure
